[One-sentence summary of what this app does.]

This README uses fixed section names and a fixed metadata table so it can be rendered as normal Markdown today and parsed into App Gallery components later.

## Summary

[App Title] is a Cribl app for [primary use case]. It helps users [outcome 1], [outcome 2], and [outcome 3].

Use this section for the short, customer-facing description that should also work in an overview card or detail page.

## What This App Does

Describe the app in plain language.

Suggested structure:
* Primary purpose: [brief description]
* Key capabilities:
  * [Capability 1]
  * [Capability 2]
  * [Capability 3]
* Intended users:
  * [Admin / Analyst / Platform owner / Builder / Other]
* Works with:
  * [Stream / Edge / Search / Lake / Cribl.Cloud / Hybrid / Other]

## When To Use This App

List the main scenarios where this app is useful.

* [Use case 1]
* [Use case 2]
* [Use case 3]

## Before You Install

List anything a user or admin should know before installation.

* Required Cribl product or deployment type: [for example Cribl.Cloud, hybrid, distributed group]
* Required permissions or roles: [list roles or permissions]
* Required external systems or APIs: [if any]
* Required configuration values: [API endpoint, dataset, token source, workspace selection, and so on]
* Known limits or prerequisites: [quota, feature flag, environment requirements]

## Installation

Use Marketplace installation as the default path whenever the app is available there. This gives users the easiest install path and makes future upgrades simpler.

### Install From Marketplace or URL
1. Go to Apps in your Cribl environment.
2. Choose the Marketplace or import from URL option.
3. If the app is available in the Cribl Marketplace, install it directly from there.
4. If the app is distributed as a Marketplace-hosted URL, use the URL to import it.
5. Review the app details and complete installation.

Why this is the preferred path:
* Simplest user experience
* Easier to adopt future releases
* Cleaner upgrade path when newer versions are published

### If The App Is Not Yet In The Cribl Marketplace
1. Go to the app's GitHub repository.
2. Open the Releases section.
3. Download the `.tgz` app package for the version you want.
4. In Cribl, go to Apps and choose import from file.
5. Upload the downloaded `.tgz` file.
6. Review the app details and complete installation.

Use this path when the app has not yet been published to the Cribl Marketplace or when you need to install a specific release artifact manually.

## Configuration

Explain exactly what a user needs to fill in when the app is first created or configured.

| Setting | Required | Description | Example | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Setting name] | Yes/No | [What this field is for] | [Example value] | [per-user, per-app, shared] |
| [Setting name] | Yes/No | [What this field is for] | [Example value] | [per-user, per-app, shared] |
| [Setting name] | Yes/No | [What this field is for] | [Example value] | [per-user, per-app, shared] |

Add guidance such as:
* Which fields are mandatory
* Which fields are optional
* Safe defaults
* What happens if a field is left blank
* Whether settings are per-user, per-app, or shared

## How To Use

Describe the happy path for a new user.

### Typical Workflow
1. Open the app from the Apps page.
2. Review or update the app settings.
3. Provide the required inputs.
4. Run the main workflow or action.
5. Review the output, results, or generated state.

### First-Run Checklist
* [Step 1]
* [Step 2]
* [Step 3]

## Permissions

Document the permissions the app expects and how it behaves if a user lacks them.

Include:
* Required permissions for core functionality
* Optional permissions for enhanced features
* Any APIs or resources the app reads or writes
* What users should expect if access is denied

### Cribl API Endpoints Used

List every Cribl API endpoint the app uses. Add one row per endpoint.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/...` | [What the call does and why the app needs it] |
| POST | `/api/v1/...` | [What the call does and why the app needs it] |
| PUT | `/api/v1/...` | [What the call does and why the app needs it] |

Suggested text:
This app should handle permission differences gracefully where possible. If a user lacks access to an optional API or resource, the app should continue to function for supported workflows and show a helpful message instead of failing completely.

## External API Access

If applicable, describe any bundled defaults or external access patterns.

### Default Configuration
* `default/proxies.yml` — [what it contains]
* `default/policies.yml` — [what it contains]
* Any other shipped config — [description]

### External Endpoints
* [Service name] — [purpose]
* [Service name] — [purpose]

If the app makes no external calls, say so clearly.

## Data And Storage

Explain what the app stores or changes.

Example topics:
* KV keys used by the app
* Whether data is persisted
* Whether data is shared across users
* Cleanup behavior on uninstall, if known
* Any quotas or limits that affect usage

## Support

Choose one support model and remove the others.

Also tell users exactly how to reach the developer or maintainer for this app. Include a clear support path such as an email address, Slack channel, GitHub issues page, support alias, or team name.

### Cribl Built
This app is built by Cribl and supported by Cribl. Issues, bugs, and questions should follow standard Cribl support channels. Also include the owning team and the best contact path for the app maintainer.

### Partner Built
This app is built by [Partner Name]. The partner owns support, maintenance, and feature requests for this app. Cribl does not provide direct support for app-specific behavior unless explicitly stated. Also include the partner support contact and the best developer or maintainer contact path.

### Community Built
This app is provided as a community contribution. It may be useful for learning, experimentation, or shared workflows, but it does not carry an official support commitment from Cribl. Maintenance and updates depend on the community maintainer. Also include how users can reach the maintainer or contributor.

### Internal Only
This app is intended for internal use, experiments, demos, or proof-of-concept workflows. It should not be treated as a generally supported production app unless its support model changes. Also include the internal owner and how to contact the developer or team responsible for the app.

## Known Limitations

Use this section to set expectations.

* [Limitation 1]
* [Limitation 2]
* [Limitation 3]

## Troubleshooting

### The App Opens But Some Features Do Not Work
Possible causes:
* Missing permissions
* Missing required settings
* External dependency unavailable
* Unsupported environment

### The App Cannot Connect To An API Or Service
Check:
* App settings
* Network or proxy configuration
* Credentials or tokens
* Allowed endpoints

### The App Works Locally But Not In Cribl
Check:
* Packaging and deployment version
* Runtime configuration
* Required platform globals or APIs
* Environment-specific permissions

## Development

If this repository is also intended for builders, include a short developer section.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run package
```

Document:
* How to run locally
* Any important environment differences
* How to package and test the app
* Where the main source files live

If your app has backend endpoints (`config/backend.yml` + `backend/`), `npm run build` runs `apps build` to bundle each endpoint into one self-contained file before packaging. Backend endpoint permissions are not declared in `backend.yml`; they use `config/policies.yml` (Cribl API) and `config/proxies.yml` (external egress), app-wide. See `AGENTS.md` for the endpoint contract.
